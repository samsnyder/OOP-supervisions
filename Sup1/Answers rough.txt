1.	In functional languages once you declare a variable/value, you cannot change it. You can only reassign the value by declaring it again.

In functional languages, for any given input paramaters, you would get the same output every time. i.e. the output does not depend on machine state, time, operating system etc.

Functional languages are able to optimise tail recursion. This makes recursion much more efficient and is used as oppose to loops.

6.	This doesn't work because in vectorAdd, x and y are local variables in that frame. So when they are set, they are completely separate to a and b in main.
